README ‚Äì Adaptive Constitution DAO (Self-Evolving Governance Contract)

üìú Overview

The Adaptive Constitution Contract defines a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) whose governance rules rewrite themselves dynamically based on the outcomes and measured effectiveness of previous proposals. It is designed to simulate a self-learning governance model where community decisions influence the evolution of constitutional thresholds and governance parameters over time.

The contract enables:

Proposal creation and voting,

Dynamic adjustment of governance thresholds,

On-chain constitutional amendments, and

Feedback-driven evolution of DAO rules.

‚öôÔ∏è Core Concepts

Adaptive Governance:

The DAO automatically adjusts its voting thresholds (success-threshold) depending on the measured effectiveness of previously executed proposals.

Ineffective proposals increase the approval threshold; highly effective ones slightly lower it.

This feedback loop helps maintain balance between progress and caution in governance.

Constitutional Rules:

Rules are stored in constitution-rules and define the DAO‚Äôs operating principles.

Each rule includes a textual description, weight, activation status, and creation timestamp.

Rules can be modified through successful proposals.

Proposals and Voting:

Members can create proposals suggesting rule changes.

Voting is open for a defined voting-period and requires a quorum and success threshold to pass.

Votes are weighted based on voting-power.

Proposal Execution:

Once a proposal‚Äôs voting period ends, any user may execute it.

Successful proposals apply their rule changes and are recorded in proposal-outcomes.

Measuring Effectiveness:

The contract owner measures each proposal‚Äôs post-implementation effectiveness with a score (0‚Äì100).

This score informs whether the DAO should tighten or relax its future approval requirements.

Adaptive Feedback Logic:

If a passed proposal‚Äôs effectiveness < 30%, the approval threshold increases (up to 80%).

If effectiveness > 70%, the threshold decreases (down to a minimum of 51%).

This creates an adaptive, learning-based governance mechanism.

üß© Key Data Structures
Structure	Purpose
constitution-rules	Stores the text and metadata of DAO rules.
proposals	Holds proposal details, including proposed rule changes, vote counts, and status.
votes	Tracks individual member votes to prevent duplicates.
voting-power	Defines each member‚Äôs voting influence.
proposal-outcomes	Records whether proposals passed and their measured effectiveness.
üîê Access Control

CONTRACT_OWNER: The contract deployer, authorized to grant voting power and measure proposal effectiveness.

Other members can create and vote on proposals based on their assigned voting power.

üßÆ Adjustable Parameters
Parameter	Description	Default
min-voting-power	Minimum power required to create proposals	u1
voting-period	Voting duration in blocks (~10 days)	u1440
quorum-threshold	Minimum % of total power needed to validate results	u50
success-threshold	% of yes votes required for passage	u60
üîß Key Public Functions
Function	Purpose
create-proposal	Create a new proposal with rule changes
vote	Cast a vote on an active proposal
execute-proposal	Execute a proposal after voting ends
measure-proposal-effectiveness	Assign a post-outcome effectiveness score and trigger adaptive changes
grant-voting-power	Grant voting rights to DAO members
get-proposal, get-constitution-rule, get-voting-power, get-current-thresholds	Read-only data retrieval functions
üß† How It Learns

Each proposal contributes to the DAO‚Äôs governance evolution:

Members vote ‚Üí proposal passes/fails.

Owner measures effectiveness.

Contract adapts success-threshold accordingly.

Over time, the DAO‚Äôs constitution self-optimizes for decision quality.

üöÄ Deployment Notes

Deploying the contract automatically runs initialize-constitution, setting the three foundational governance rules.

The contract can be extended to include:

Historical analytics,

Member registries,

Token-based voting mechanisms.
